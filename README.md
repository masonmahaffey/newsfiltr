# Newsfiltr

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4 and uses a nodejs backend. A separate repository for the backend can be found under my repository list.

Newsfiltr is intended to be a place for avid news readers to give feedback on the validity of news articles. It's meant to keep news organizations from running amok and to stand as a force of accountability towards organizations with rampant biases.

This project is still in the works and is by no means complete. It remains as an enjoyable side project I work on in my spare time!! ðŸ˜œ
